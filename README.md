## 📖 Overview

**Intelligent Design System & Color Engine** is a developer-centric tool that bridges the gap between design creativity and engineering implementation. 

Unlike standard color pickers, this application doesn't just give you a hex code. It uses mathematical algorithms to generate **production-ready design systems**, complete with 10-shade harmonic scales, real-time accessibility auditing, and instant UI visualization.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎨 Algorithmic Scale Generation:** Instantly creates 10-step monochromatic scales (50–900) based on relative luminance, mimicking modern frameworks like Tailwind CSS.
- **👁️ Real-Time UI Preview:** Visualizes your palette on a live, interactive landing page mockup (60fps updates via CSS Variables).
- **♿ Automated Accessibility:** Integrated WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA contrast checker that flags legibility issues in real-time.
- **📦 Developer Exports:** One-click export for `tailwind.config.js`, SCSS variables, and CSS Custom Properties.
- **🌗 Smart Theming:** Automatically calculates and previews Dark Mode variants.
